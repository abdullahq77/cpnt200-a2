## Struggles/Notes
Had some trouble connecting to the database but got that figured out with net ninja and in-class recordings.
For some reason I ran into a error on phpMyAdmin for the password and I used stackoverflow to fix it. 
I went to the config.inc.php in xampp\phpMyAdmin and changed the auth_type to 'http' and then got back into 
phpMyAdmin and was finally able to edit it. I then changed it back to 'config' from 'http'. This took me a while to get over,
but it was a great learning experience. The in-class demos  and code were also a huge help. Experimented with the code till I got it to work.
